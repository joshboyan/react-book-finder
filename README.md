# react-book-finder

This is a React Progressive Web Application using the fetch polyfill and Google Books API to 
find and sort books by a variety of filters. 
I followed Material Design principles for designing the interface. 
The initial page load is rendered on the server for improved page load speed.
The project uses the service worker API to cache the app shell and IndexedDB to store the favorites list in the browser for offline viewing.
Users can add this add to thier mobile screen thanks to the service worker API as well.
The project uses Google analytics for event tracking, uses schema markup to expose it to search engines and Open Graph Protocol for social sharing.
