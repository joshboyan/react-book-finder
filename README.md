# react-book-finder

React application using the fetch polyfill and Google Books API to find and sort books. 
The initial page load is rendered on the server for improved page load speed.
I followed Material Design principles for designing the interface and used React-Router to navigate. 
The project uses the service worker API to cache the app shell and IndexedDB to store the favorites list in the browser for offline viewing.
